A highly configurable and comprehensive Twitter search plugin that installs as a widget.

== Description ==

A highly configurable and comprehensive Twitter search plugin that installs as a widget. The widget will display up to 30 tweets containing your search term. Some of the cool widget settings allow you to display only the top popular tweets in real time. Apart from the usual search, widget also supports Twitter's advanced search operators. Widget comes with variety of options that let you style it to fit your blog theme. In order to provide better user experience when configuring the widget, cute colour picker was included for colour selections.

Please note: 
Although I try my best to release a bug-free code, one or two may slip through. It would be so cool and I would really appreciate it if you would report any bugs to me first at http://initbinder.com/plugins, before reporting the plugin to be broken. I am quick to respond. 
Thanks!
